name: motion-use
description: Direct and render local videos with an AI coding agent — launch films, motion graphics, data stories, explainers, product walkthroughs, kinetic type, graphics over footage; Chinese/English, landscape/portrait. Writes short exact-time drawing code with a kit of helpers (camera, charts, counters, callouts, captions, handwriting, footage), renders MP4s and checks the delivered file. Also has scene templates for quick factual explainers. Use for 宣传片、推广视频、讲解视频、产品视频、数据动画, launch videos, branded motion and social clips. Does not generate photorealistic footage from text or transcribe raw footage.

# motion-use

The agent directs the film; motion-use handles assets, exact-time rendering, fonts, narration, music and delivery checks.

```bash
motion-use --version || curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeguooooo/motion-use/main/install.sh | sh
motion-use doctor
```

## 1 · Plan

Use the user's subject, material and existing project; verify product claims against the source or real behavior. An invented UI, cursor walkthrough or process illustration must not pass as a real recording or real terminal output; say it is an illustration. Ask only for decisions that change the result.

`motion-use init <dir>` writes `film.json`, `composition/draw.js` and `DIRECTOR.md`. The starter is a study to replace, not a template to re-skin: a film laid out like it is flagged (`demo_similarity`).

- Lock `look`: one style sentence, one palette, the character approach (none, hands, footage, generated frames — not code-drawn mascots).
- Each shot names an object you could point at, what *it* does, its `camera` move and the ≤ 8 words on screen. Open on a concrete small scene; end on an action on the subject, not a centred card; keep one example through the film.
- Words go in `copy` per language, numbers and series in `data`, images in `assets`, footage in `videos`. Changing one value then changes one thing.
- Given a reference video, run `motion-use breakdown ref.mp4` first and learn the mechanism, not the pixels. Pick an explainer look from [references/grammars.md](references/grammars.md) by what the narration explains.
- Cutting to a song or building a UI-morph loop: ask for the inputs in [references/briefing.md](references/briefing.md), run `motion-use beats song.wav`, and show the shot list on the beat grid before writing code.

## 2 · Write the drawing

Read [references/kit.md](references/kit.md) — one page that covers most films. `M.shoot`, `M.chart`, `M.counter`, `M.callout`, `M.words`, `M.stamp`, `M.cover`/`M.video`, `M.cursor`, `M.spotlight`, `M.signature`, `M.captions` and the timing helpers keep a film to a few kilobytes; write custom drawing where the subject needs it. Move on events: hold → 0.28 s push / 0.30 s pan / 0.17 s slam → hold. In portrait, keep text and the key action inside `view.safe` (platform UI covers the top, bottom and right) and check with `still --guides`. Make subjects big and high-contrast. Directing method and failure modes: [references/directing.md](references/directing.md). Full contract: [references/film.md](references/film.md).

Narration is required by default: write it per shot (each language), then `motion-use voiceover <dir>`; it must fit its shot window, so shorten the script or retime the shot, never truncate. `M.captions(c, t)` draws subtitles from it. `voiceover:false` only when the user wants a silent film.

## 3 · Iterate cheaply

```bash
motion-use validate <dir>                                   # plan warnings, glyphs, narration fit
motion-use still <dir> --allow-code --shot <id>             # three frames of one shot
motion-use still <dir> --allow-code --beats 4               # one frame per bar; warns if drawing keeps state
motion-use render <dir> --allow-code --from 3 --to 7        # silent draft of a range
motion-use render <dir> --allow-code --quality draft --json # compact summary
```

Read the numbers first; open an image when they do not settle it. Fix clipping, crowding, unreadable text and decoration that does not explain. Stills cannot prove timing: watch a draft.

`--allow-code` is for projects you wrote in this task or the user trusts; code runs in the renderer and lint is not a sandbox.

## 4 · Deliver

```bash
motion-use render <dir> --allow-code --quality high --json
motion-use render <dir> --allow-code --release --json    # what goes to platforms: out/release/ + manifest
motion-use verify --manifest <dir>/out/release/release-manifest.json <file.mp4>   # before every upload
motion-use voiceover check <dir>          # whisper hears each clip; flags misreads
motion-use verify <file.mp4> --json      # any MP4, without re-rendering
```

Render writes MP4s, covers and `review/<id>/report.json` measured on the delivered file: decode, duration/fps/size, loudness (-14 LUFS / -1 dBTP), narration present in the mix, and motion lights. For films a red light fails delivery: slideshow pacing, empty mid-film frames, mostly blue-purple. Fix the film; use `--allow-static "reason"` / `--allow-blue-purple "reason"` only when the subject needs it, and tell the user.

Render also checks what eyes miss: every narration clip is transcribed and compared with its script (a flagged line names the misread: "AI" spoken "A-A-I" → write "A I"; 重试 heard 重视 → 再试), and every drawn string is measured against the frame and, in portrait, the safe area (text off the edge for 0.3 s or more is reported with its time), and two strings drawn over each other while both are visible are reported too (a cross-fade that stacks the old and new line for a few frames). `--gate` makes these fatal. Each render keeps its exact inputs (film, code, voiceover clips) as a snapshot; `render --snapshot <id>` rebuilds that cut after the narration changed. Publish only files from `--release` (x264 veryslow CRF 16; a ≤45 MB X copy when needed), and check each with `verify --manifest` so a stale or README-sized cut never goes out.

A technical pass is not visual approval. Before delivering, have someone who did not make the film review it: spawn a fresh agent with only the MP4, its contact sheet and the intended takeaway; it writes timecoded issues into `<dir>/reviews/<round>.md`. After three substantial passes, disclose what remains. Keep feedback and `## Lessons` (do / evidence / why / when) in DIRECTOR.md. Report exactly what was measured, what was watched and what was not listened to. Do not publish unless asked.

## Scene templates

For quick information cards or an existing `brief.json`: `motion-use init <dir> --mode template --style explainer`, then `validate`, `still`, `render` on `<dir>/brief.json`. Schema: [references/brief.md](references/brief.md); narratives: [references/stories.md](references/stories.md).

## Rules

- Rendering is local; narration generation uses the voice service. Update checks run at most daily (`MOTION_USE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` disables them).
- Preserve user files; motion-use never overwrites outputs it did not write. Do not run two jobs on the same output folder.
- Missing edge-tts: `uv tool install edge-tts`, then retry. Never disable narration as a workaround. edge-tts is a preview voice; public videos need suitably licensed speech (Azure).
- Install and update through GitHub Releases; `motion-use upgrade` refreshes the CLI and this skill.
