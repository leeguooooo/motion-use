# Authored films

`film.json` fixes output timing and assets; `composition/draw.js` owns the entire picture. `DIRECTOR.md` records the directing choices and review. How to plan, pace and review a film: [directing.md](directing.md). Explainer looks: [grammars.md](grammars.md). Rendering preserves exact shot times: there is no implicit title entrance, crossfade, cover hold or narration stretch.

Formats: `landscape` 1920×1080, `vertical` 1080×1920, `square` 1440×1440. Frame rates: 24/25/30/60. Duration: 1–180 seconds. Shots cover the whole duration without gaps or overlap. Optional `cut: true` documents a deliberate cut (the motion check treats it as a transition); optional `hold` and `holdReason` document stillness; optional `camera` (`hold`, `push`, `pull`, `pan`, `slam`, `whip`, `follow`, `cut`, `drift`) and `text` (planned on-screen words, a string or language map) let validation check the plan. Shots annotate your code; they do not generate or impose visual scenes. Optional `loop: true` marks a film that repeats: `render` (and `verify --loop`) compares the last frame with the first and warns when the seam jumps further than an ordinary frame step.

`look` locks one `style`, a `palette` (a name from the kit or 3–6 hex colors) and the `character` approach. A blue-purple palette color is an error unless `look.allowBluePurple` gives the reason; `look.allowStatic` records why a deliberately still film may pass the motion check. Validation warns about presentation verbs in `action`, text-led opening/closing shots, shots over 8 s without `holdReason`, three identical camera moves in a row and a plan with no fast move; see [directing.md](directing.md).

## Drawing contract

```js
window.drawFrame = function (ctx, seconds, film, view, motion) {
  const {width, height, vertical} = view;
  ctx.fillStyle = "#f4f2ec";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
  const progress = motion.ramp(seconds, 0, 1);
  motion.text(ctx, film.copy.headline, width/2, height/2 + (1-progress)*100,
    vertical ? 70 : 110, "#172c2a", 800, "center", width-160);
};
```

Paint an opaque background every frame. The caller resets transforms and restores context state. All pose values must derive from the supplied time, not the last rendered frame. The renderer seeks backward and splits capture among workers; `still` redraws its first frame after the others and warns (`pure: false`) when the picture changed. Avoid clocks, unseeded random numbers, animation loops and network sourcing.

`film.copy` is already selected for the current language; `film.look` is passed through. `view` supplies width, height, format, vertical and `safe`: the box platform UI leaves visible (portrait 6–86 % × 10–76 %, otherwise 5 % margins). Keep text, subtitles and the key action inside it; `still --guides` tints the rest. `motion` provides `mix`, `clamp`, `ease` (smoothstep), `progress`, `ramp`, analytic `spring`, deterministic `hash`, `beat`, `round`, `line` and font-aware `text`. `text` shrinks a line to an explicit maximum width; `paragraph` wraps. Neither enforces platform safe areas. Design the portrait composition rather than cropping landscape.

The drawing kit adds, all pure functions of time or a seed:

| helper | |
|---|---|
| `easings.{smooth, sineInOut, cubicIn/Out/InOut, quartOut, quintOut/InOut, expoIn/Out/InOut, backOut(p, s), elasticOut, appleOut, emphasized, k75, easyEase, longTail}`, `bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)` | easing curves |
| `tween(t, start, dur, ease)` | eased progress; `ease` is a name or function (default `cubicInOut`) |
| `springHz(t, start, f, d)`, `settle(t, start, amp, f, d)`, `thereAndBack(p)`, `lagged(i, n, p, r)` | overshoot, decaying wobble, out-and-back, staggered progress |
| `follow(t, [[at, value], …], {f, d})` | a value (number or array) that changes target many times: one closed-form spring step per change, summed, so it stays a pure function of `t`; two edges on different `f` stretch a moving shape |
| `step(t, fps = 12)` | hold poses for whole steps (pass `t - at`) |
| `camera(t, events, base)`, `applyCamera(c, cam)`, `toScreen(cam, x, y)`, `zlerp`, `pulse` | pulse camera: `push` (k, x, y), `pan`, `to` (x, y, z), `slam`, `shake`, `cut`; durations default to 0.28 / 0.30 / 0.17 s |
| `slam(t, at, {dur, from, under})` | element scale 1.55 → 0.94 → 1.0 (0 before `at`) |
| `count(t, at, dur, from, to, decimals)` | a rolling number string with thousands separators |
| `rng(seed)`, `noise(x, y)`, `fbm(x, y, octaves)` | seeded randomness and Perlin noise |
| `pathLength`, `resample`, `drawOn(c, pts, progress, style)` | draw a polyline by arc length; returns the pen tip |
| `rough(c, pts, {amp, seed, boil, t, progress, color, width, close})` | hand-drawn line; `boil: 12` re-jitters it at 12 fps |
| `write(c, text, x, y, progress, style)`, `pen(c, x, y, style)` | whiteboard handwriting and the marker |
| `wrap(c, text, maxWidth)`, `paragraph(c, text, x, y, options)` | CJK-aware wrapping; shrinks to `maxLines` |
| `palettes`, `palette(nameOrColors?)` | `{bg, surface, ink, sub, accent, accent2}`; defaults to `film.look.palette` |
| `paper(c, key, {base, amount, grain})`, `texture(key, options)` | a static paper texture painted once and reused |

Composed helpers build on these: `shoot`, `card`, `pill`, `ripple`, `stroke`, `node`, `signature`, `caption`/`captions`, `words`, `counter`, `chart`, `callout`, `stamp`, `spotlight`, `cursor`, `cover`, `video`, `grade`, `grain`, `vignette`, plus `unit`, `lerp2`, `add`, `ring`. Their signatures and a worked example are in [kit.md](kit.md). New helpers never replace an existing `motion` name, so older drawing code renders identically.

## Data, footage and subtitles

`data` holds named values and series (≤ 100 KB) passed to the page as `film.data`; `chart`, `counter` and friends read them by key, and labels may be language maps. Changing a number in `film.json` changes that number in every language and format.

`videos` declares footage: `{"name": {"file": "footage/demo.mp4", "at": 4, "from": 12.5, "rate": 1, "length": 6, "volume": 0}}`. `at` is the film second where the clip starts, `from` the source second, `rate` 0.25–4. The build extracts exactly the frames that window needs (film fps ÷ rate, ≤ 5,400 per film) as JPEGs, and the page loads the frames a seek needs before drawing, so footage stays deterministic and seekable. `motion.video(name, t)` returns the current frame (or `null` outside the clip) for `cover` or `drawImage`. Footage sound plays when `volume > 0`, only at rate 1. Validation rejects clips that run past their source or the film.

`film.captions` is `[{text, start, end, estimated?}]` for the narration placed in the current language: sentence cues timed by edge-tts when the clip still matches its script, otherwise sentences timed by character share and marked `estimated`. `motion.captions(c, t)` draws them in a safe lower slot. Word-level timing is not available; pass explicit `times` to `words` for word-accurate emphasis.

`render --from A --to B` renders a silent draft of that window into `out/preview/` with motion lights but no delivery checks. `still --shot id` captures the first settled frame, the middle and the last frame of a shot.

Declare local PNG/JPG/WebP/SVG images under `assets`, e.g. `{"logo":"images/logo.png"}`. They are decoded before rendering and available as `window.filmAssets.logo`; draw with `ctx.drawImage`. Only named files are copied. Paths must remain inside the project, including symlink targets. Fonts ship as local subset WOFF2s with their licenses; visible copy and drawing-source characters enter the subset. Missing glyphs in `copy` fail validation.

Optional `libraries: ["vendor/library.js"]` loads explicit local classic browser bundles before the drawing code. Bundle ES modules into a browser file first. The film directory is not recursively copied. Optional `window.setupFilm(film, view, motion)` can return a promise to prepare geometry/renderers after fonts and images load; the engine waits for it. A WebGL renderer can draw into its own offscreen canvas and composite it into `ctx` during `drawFrame`. This is an authoring capability, not a built-in 3D scene generator. Use `--gpu` only when the shader/library needs hardware rendering; state the reproducibility tradeoff.

`motionBlur` samples 1/2/4 subframes over a 0–1 frame backward shutter and averages the rendered canvases. The sampling order is deterministic. Default: one sample, no blur. Tune exposure for readable movement; blur does not rescue an unclear layout.

## Narration is required by default

Add `narration` to each narrated shot as a language map, e.g. `{"zh":"发一条消息。","en":"Send a message."}`. A root `narration` map instead makes one continuous track. Optional `voiceover` settings accept `dir`, `engine` (`azure`/`edge`), `voices`, `rate` and `volume`. Defaults: `voiceover/`, configured Azure or the Edge preview provider, and the bundled Chinese/English voice choices. For other languages, set an appropriate voice explicitly.

`motion-use voiceover <project>` supports films and caches one audio file per language/shot. `render` automatically generates missing or outdated narration before frame capture. Generation uses the voice provider's network service; the frame renderer stays local. Imported `audio` tracks with `role: "voiceover"` take precedence. Optional `lang` selects one language; omit it for an intentionally shared track. User recordings are preserved.

Each shot's spoken window starts 80 ms after its start and ends 80 ms before its end. Whole-film narration has 100 ms at each edge. Audio that does not fit fails: shorten the script or retime the authored shots and drawing; words are never trimmed to fit. `voiceover:false` opts into a deliberately unnarrated film, not an automatic fallback after a provider failure.

Final delivery verifies that the voice-only reference actually appears in the MP4's mix, using per-window waveform correlation and non-silence checks. This checks presence and alignment of the expected signal, not speech recognition or listening quality. A music-only MP4 cannot pass required narration, and a failed candidate never replaces the last delivered video. Generated audio and voice manifests are excluded from release packages. Narrated film filenames end in `-VO.mp4`, making them distinct from older unnarrated exports.

## Sound and narration

`music` accepts `"none"`, `"builtin"`, `{"builtin":"pulse","volume":0.6,"hits":[4.6,9.2]}` or `{"file":"audio/song.wav","volume":0.6,"bpm":120,"from":1.3}`. Built-in moods: `promo`, `explainer`, `pulse` (plucked strings, soft downbeat), `chiptune`, `pentatonic` (plucked D minor pentatonic) and `ambient`; `hits` adds a thump and a plucked accent at those seconds. Root `bpm` wins over the music's BPM; a built-in mood otherwise sets the tempo. Built-in music uses that same tempo, so `motion.beat(seconds)` lines up with it. For imported music, `motion-use beats song.wav` measures the tempo, the first downbeat, per-bar loudness and the drop (4/4 assumed) and prints `{"file", "bpm", "from"}`: `from` is the song second that plays at film second 0, so starting on the downbeat makes `motion.beat(t)` count the song's beats. `still --beats 1` (or `4` for one per bar) renders a frame on every beat of the grid.

```json
"audio": [
  {"file":"audio/narration.wav","role":"voiceover","start":1.2,"offset":0,"length":4.5,"volume":1},
  {"file":"audio/click.wav","role":"sfx","start":3.6,"volume":0.5}
]
```

Times refer to the output timeline. Omitted `length` uses the remaining source duration. Validation rejects a source overrun or a clip running past the film; trim it explicitly or extend the authored picture. Voiceover windows duck the music with short ramps. HyperFrames owns media playback and the final mix; the drawing code does not play audio. `render` normalizes the final track without re-encoding the video. Imported audio must already have suitable authorization.

For bundled licensed sounds, use `{"effect":"click","role":"sfx","start":3.38,"volume":0.6}` instead of a file. Effects: `click`, `switch`, `whoosh`, `ding`; sources/licenses are in ASSETS.md. `start` is the beginning of the file, not its loudest transient. Add `"align": "peak"` to any clip and validation measures where it peaks and moves it so that moment lands on `start` (trimming the head when the clip would begin before 0).

## Delivery review

`render` writes a technical report and contact sheet from the delivered MP4. It checks full-file decoding, measured dimensions/FPS/duration, audio presence, integrated loudness, true peak and per-shot RMS. Black intervals and freeze starts over 0.8 seconds are signals to inspect. Review times include the opening, shot midpoints, the final frame, and both sides of shot boundaries.

`motion` in the report holds the motion lights measured on the MP4: fast movement inside shots, empty mid-film frames and blue-purple share (thresholds and calibration in [directing.md](directing.md)). For authored films a red light fails delivery and the previous video stays in place; `--allow-static "why"` / `--allow-blue-purple "why"` (or the matching `look` fields) downgrade it to yellow and are recorded under `motion.allowed`. Films shorter than 20 s get yellow instead of red for pacing. `independent_reviews` lists `reviews/*.md` notes written by someone who watched only the MP4. `motion.demo_similarity` is the share of frames that follow the starter or a bundled example: runs of at least three consecutive frames whose layout matches one demo (edges and brightness, polarity ignored, so a re-coloured copy still counts) while advancing through it in order. A single look-alike frame does not count. A warning at 0.3; never a gate. `render --json` prints a compact summary; add `--verbose` for every narration segment and motion light.

`narration_check`: before capture, render transcribes every generated narration clip (faster-whisper through `uv`, model `small` unless `--asr-model`; transcripts cached in `voiceover/.motion-use-asr.json` by clip hash) and compares it with its script. Flagged: an acronym or Latin word heard differently ("AI" spoken "A-A-I" — spell it "A I" in the script, subtitles may keep "AI"), a homophone that forms a dictionary word with a many-reading neighbour (重试 heard 重视: the voice read 重 as zhòng — use 再试), a different-sounding word, missing or extra words, or a line under 80 % similar. Plain ASR spelling (它 → 他) is listed but not flagged. Without `uv` or the model the check is skipped with a note. `motion-use voiceover check <dir>` runs it alone; `--no-asr` skips it.

`text_check`: render and still draw the film every 0.1 s on a private canvas and measure each `fillText`/`strokeText` box through the current transform. Text partly off the frame for 0.3 s or more is reported with its string and time (a whip through an edge is not); in portrait, text outside `view.safe` likewise. Text drawn into your own offscreen canvas is not seen. `--gate` makes a flagged narration line or off-frame text fail the render; `--no-text-check` skips it.

`snapshot`: each full render stores its inputs (film.json, drawing code, voiceover clips and their manifest, footage, images, music; files over 200 MB by hash only) under `out/.snapshots/`, deduplicated by sha256. `render --snapshot <id or release-manifest.json>` restores them and renders into `out/snapshot-<id>/` — the same cut after the narration or film changed (with the same motion-use version, bit-identical).

`render --release`: renders at high quality with near-lossless CRF 10, then encodes the platform masters into `out/release/`: `<name>-<lang>-<format>.mp4` (x264 veryslow, CRF 16, yuv420p, faststart, AAC 192 kbps 48 kHz), a two-pass `-x.mp4` under 45 MB for X when a landscape master is larger, and the cover. `release-manifest.json` lists every file with sha256, size, duration, fps, bitrate, dimensions, its voiceover hashes, the snapshot and the motion-use version. `motion-use verify --manifest <manifest> [file]` passes only for a file that is byte-for-byte a listed master; a same-named file with other bytes is reported as a stale or edited cut. `--max-size`/`--target github` are for README copies, never for release.

`visual_review: "pending"` is intentional: neither a successful encode nor a numeric report proves the film looks good. Canvas typography is invisible to DOM text audits. Read the frames and watch the MP4; record the outcome and remaining concerns in `DIRECTOR.md`. Review files are written only into directories owned by motion-use. Concurrent renders/stills targeting the same output are unsupported.

## Existing briefs

`brief.json` and `--style` / `--story` keep their previous scene behavior. Use `--mode template` explicitly when creating information-card videos. `--allow-code` authorizes film code; `--allow-custom-html` remains the separate opt-in for template HTML scenes. Validation never executes the authored script. Static lint checks are not a security boundary for arbitrary code.
