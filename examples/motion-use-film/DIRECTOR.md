# motion-use promo (2026-10-11) · 60 s · zh / en

**Takeaway**: a coding agent directs the film as code, renders it on your machine, then measures the MP4 it delivered. Said in the first sentence, over six real films made with motion-use.

**Look**: an editing bench on warm paper. Real films play as black-bordered prints; the real code and real tool output sit on dark cards; one orange perforated tape runs under every station and carries the eye from one to the next. Palette locked in `look` (paper, ink, signal orange, check green); no blue-purple.

**Everything on screen is real**:

- The prints are footage of films rendered by motion-use: the iphone-use promo release cuts, ocs-film, data-story, whiteboard, kinetic, and the yarn relay. `footage/*.mp4` are composites built from those MP4s with ffmpeg (a 3×2 wall, zh|en side by side, four formats), so the film stays inside the 5,400-frame footage budget; the drawing crops each print out of the composite frame.
- The code card is the first lines of the iphone-use promo's `composition/draw.js`. Sizes: `draw.js` 15,989 B + `film.json` 9,950 B = 25.9 KB ("26 KB"); its release MP4 is 10.2 MB.
- The terminal is `motion-use verify iphone-use-zh-vertical.mp4` output (v0.6.0): 1080×1920, 60 fps, 3330 frames, −14.93 LUFS, true peak −0.88 dBTP, fast_ratio 0.0828 green, blank 0, blue-purple 0, demo_similarity 0.
- The safe-area frame is real `motion-use still --guides` output of the iphone-use vertical cut at 9 s.
- "Text off the frame" is the iphone-use en-landscape cut at 43.5 s before round 7's fix (`images/clip-before.png`) and after it (`clip-after.png`).
- The voiceover-check card is `motion-use voiceover check` (v0.7.0, whisper small) on the iphone-use round-6 lines re-voiced with the same edge-tts voice: "让 AAI 直接操作你的真iphone" and "…能不能重视", with the tool's own suggestions ("A I", 重试 → 再试).

## Beats

| time | narration (zh) | picture |
|---|---|---|
| 0–7.4 | motion-use 让 coding agent 当导演… | the six-film wall under the headline; slow push, then a push toward the yarn and iPhone prints |
| 7.4–16.35 | 每一帧都是时间的函数… | whip to the code card typing beside the iPhone promo; its clock `t` runs; source bar (26 KB) against the MP4 bar (10.2 MB), to scale |
| 16.35–22.75 | 画风每次重新设计… | four prints with unrelated looks fly into a row, each labelled |
| 22.75–31.2 | 本地渲染完，它把成片解码一遍… | verify output types; three lights turn green as their lines land |
| 31.2–37 | 竖版会标出平台按钮挡住的区域，字和重点都避开它。 | the guides still rises, a scan line checks it top to bottom |
| 37–46.4 | 上一支片子里，配音念错了字… | the clipped callout gets boxed, flips to the fixed frame; the voiceover check prints script / heard / fix |
| 46.4–54 | 一份源码，出中文和英文、横版和竖版… | one print opens into the four real cuts |
| 54–60 | motion-use，开源，一行命令就能装。 | wordmark, underline drawn, install command types and holds |

## Checks run

- Narration: own ASR pass (faster-whisper small and large-v3-turbo) and `motion-use voiceover check`: all 16 clips pass. Changed before release: 母版 (both models heard 模板) → 高画质文件; 风格 (heard 分隔) → 画风; "26 KB" → "26 kilobytes" in English (the check reads KB as an acronym).
- Text in frame: v0.7.0 flagged the code card running off the left edge during a camera push at 10.7–12.5 s; the push no longer moves sideways.
- Motion: green (draft fast_ratio 0.11).

## Review round 1 (independent, codex, MP4 only) → changes

Verdict on the first draft: don't ship either cut. Fixed:

- **Text collision inside the inset iPhone film** at 10.25 s and 47.25 s: the iphone-use promo itself crossfades two headline lines over each other around its 2.5–3.5 s. Both composites now start outside that window (ip from source 5 s, formats from 12 s); the code card's clock counts from 5 s accordingly. (The collision is in the published iphone-use cut, not in this film.)
- **zh safe-area line was ambiguous** ("放在里面" read as inside the covered area): now "字和重点都避开它".
- **English viewers could not read the Chinese ASR evidence**: the en cut adds a gloss under each heard line ("AI" read as A-A-I; 重试 (retry) read as 重视 (value)).
- Non-blocking, also done: "this 55-second film" → "example"; "No templates" (scene templates do exist) → "a look of its own"; terminal cards labelled "real output · motion-use <version>"; the tape moved below the subtitles.
- Prints going empty while the camera left a station (footage clip ended first): every clip now runs until its station is off screen.

## Lessons

- Do: composite real footage into one clip and crop prints out of it in the drawing. Evidence: six films in one 22.75 s clip cost 1,365 extracted frames instead of 8,190. Why: the footage budget counts film frames per clip. When: any wall of videos.
- Do: let the new checks run on every draft. Evidence: the off-frame code and the 风格 misread were both found by the tool, not by looking. When: always; they are on by default in v0.7.0.
